<HTML><BODY>This travelogue from 1847 gives a first impression of Assam at that time. A few tables, and several pages of advertising at the end, for the rest a fairly easy book. The lovely color illustrations have been placed at the end for proofing reasons, but will be included, in full glory at their original locations in the final product.

<p>Have fun!
